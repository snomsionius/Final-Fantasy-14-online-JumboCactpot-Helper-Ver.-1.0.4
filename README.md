# Cactpot-Helper
While one cant exactly predict the winning numbers of the FF14 Jumbo Cactor, you can certainly try to make a guess.
Based on a dataset of past winners, you certainly can try to calculate a winning number. In my opinion, there is a scheme behind the numbers, 
but noone knows for sure.Time will tell if im right or not.

The datasheet gets updated with future Cactpot draws to make a more accurate guess on what the lucky number could be.

Your PC might give you a warning that your PC got protected from a virus or smth.
